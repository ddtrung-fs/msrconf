## <a name="Bacchelli"></a>Alberto Bacchelli

Candidate statement:
> The mining software repositories field has revolutionized empirical software engineering, both in academia and in industry. However, MSR conference cannot rest on its laurels: We need to improve further to remain relevant.
> 
> In my tenure, I will focus on making sure that MSR continues to be an incubator of novel ideas and techniques, as well as a place to grow the next generation of researchers.
> 
> I will direct my attention to:
> - Attract experienced SE newcomers (including established researchers at ICSE who are not targeting MSR) and non-SE newcomers (such as researchers in CSCW and CHI) to the MSR community, to broaden our visibility, scope, and community knowledge.
> - Ensure that the important role of the MSR Challenge and the MSR short and data papers is maintained: Good options for students and new researchers to engage with our work.
> - Strengthen how we can replicate and build upon our studies, by incentivizing the creation of publicly accessible datasets and tools.
> - Valorize our research and results with industry, by rethinking how we promote our conference and studies.
> - Improve the logistics of the conference. MSR is growing steadily and quickly, but our current setup is not optimal due to the ever-increasing number of submissions and limited presentation time. I will engage with the other members of steering committee and the whole community to find viable and new solutions to this problem to give the right space to MSR is, also including the idea of having two editions of MSR: One co-located with ICSE and ICPC, another with FSE and SBSE, since they all have strong connections with our research and we should strengthen these ties even further.

## <a name="Ray"></a>Baishakhi Ray 

Candidate statement:
> MSR is at the forefront of the big data revolution in Software Engineering. It has impacted Software Engineering research starting from recommendation systems, text analytics, GitHub analytics, socio-technical analysis, and many more. In a way, empirical software engineering research led by MSR has revolutionized the way we look at Software Engineering research, and the impact can be seen in the number of papers appeared in ICSE, FSE, and ASE --- a majority of them are now related to empirical software engineering.
> 
> I am very fortunate to consider myself an integral member of MSR community. I have regularly published in MSR from my student days. I also served as PC of MSR multiple times. Thus, I will consider myself truly fortunate if I can serve this community and make contributions to shape its future directions.  My career has been hugely influenced by MSR Vision 2020 that was held in Kingston in 2012. It was very inspiring to attend several panels summarizing the big picture and predicting future MSR research trends. I think MSR should conduct such sessions where the senior researchers of the field can have more focused and close interactions with the upcoming young researchers from diverse background.
> 
> I also think Software Analytics can have far more impact beyond the academic Software Engineering community. If elected, I will try to improve the visibility of the conference among the broader audience by including more people from industries, and other related fields like security, machine learning, etc. Given that big code is becoming very relevant with a large number of papers published in ICLR, ACL, etc., it is essential to include researchers from those communities to increase our visibility. Thus, I envision a bright future of MSR harnessing more interdisciplinary culture that will help Empirical Research to reach its pinnacle.

## <a name="Sami"></a>Ashkan Sami

Candidate statement:
> Even though I teach mainly software engineering courses at graduate and undergraduate level, my research background is not purely software engineering. I categorize myself as an applied data scientist interested in solving highly complex and difficult engineering problems. My work is interdisciplinary in nature and I enjoy collaborating with great number of erudite scholars in variety of fields. Since I have a different background, I feel I may provide new aspects in expanding MSR community to other fields as an interdisciplinary research. As an interdisciplinary data scientist, I sometimes feel use of statistical analysis on research results are not adequate for the conclusions drawn. For instance, observations that are not statistically proven different are not the same but in rare cases I have seen the conclusion is drawn. I hope my diverse statistical and machine learning background on validation methods in other fields can add value to the community and make their daunting task a bit easier. In addition, I hope by sitting next to other great scientist in MSR community, I can make MSR participation and contributions of less privileged researchers with limited resources to attend through regular registration possible or easier. I very much share the vision of alternative presentation methods and would do my best in this regard. Finally, I see scientific diplomacy can and have bridged the gap and solved political problems that others could not solve. So I see joining the committee as a method to serve this purpose also.

## <a name="Shihab"></a>Emad Shihab

Candidate statement:
> I have been an active member of the MSR community since my PhD student days; when I attended the 5th MSR conference. I was involved in the MSR community in different roles, serving as the web chair, challenge chair, data showcase chair and as a PC member for many years. I promise to work tirelessly to make future MSRs fruitful and welcoming to all, especially students and young researchers. If elected, I would like to see MSR integrate novel ways to deal with (amongst others) a) our rapidly growing community, b) the growing volume and variety of data at our disposable, and c) the actionability and applicability of our MSR techniques. In particular, I would like to introduce activities within the conference to facilitate collaboration between attendees. I would also like to create a database of expertise and data to enable rapid developments of MSR techniques - in many occasions we end up mining data that someone else already has. Moreover, I would like to help increase the involvement of industry and the open source community in MSR, through panels and invited MSR-reflections abstracts, so our techniques can be actionably grounded. My prior experience involves community service where I served and successfully organized a number of workshops and tracks at MSR, PROMISE and SANER. I am excited at the potential of being part of, and would be honoured to serve on, the MSR steering committee.
