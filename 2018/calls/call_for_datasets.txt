MSR 2018 Open Call for Mining Challenge Proposals
 
This year we are soliciting mining challenge proposals from the MSR
community. Submissions should include the following information 
within 1 page:
 
    1. Title
    2. What is your dataset?
    3. What is the size of it?
    4. How accessible is it and how can the data be obtained?
    5. How generalizable is it?
    6. Does it has specialized components?
    7. What would a challenger need to work with the dataset?
    8. What kind of questions do you expect challengers to answer?
    9. Give us a small sample of the data.
 
Submissions should be 1 page with an optional 3 page appendix in
standard ACM format. As an incentive, the selected winning submission
will appear in the MSR 2018 proceedings and the challenge papers that
use the data set will be required to cite the challenge paper or an
existing paper about the data set selected by the winning proposal
team. Submissions will be examined and discussed by the MSR 2018 PC
chairs, General Chair, and potentially steering committee members in
cases of conflict of interest. The challenge chairs will be those from
the winning proposal's team; the challenge chairs choose the MSR 2018
Mining Challenge program committee.
 
The PC of the challenge track will be finalized by September 13th, 2017,
and the challenge CFP along with the PC will be announced on September
13th, 2017 along with a public release of the challenge data. By
making the challenge data set available by late August, we hope that
many student teams will be able to use the challenge data set for
their class projects. The submission, reviewing, and presentation of
challenge papers will be conducted in the same way as previous years.
