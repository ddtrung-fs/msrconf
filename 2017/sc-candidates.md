# MSR Steering Committee Elections 2017

The MSR conference will have open elections for two new members for the MSR Steering Committee (SC). The Steering Committee provides general guidance and direction for the MSR Conference; it also selects future GC and PC Chairs. The term is three years. Members of the SC are expected to participate in MSR SC meetings, that will be held via Skype calls and physically during ICSE week. 

We are honored to announce that the following candidates are running for the steering committee (in alphabetical order). The statements and biographies on this page have been provided by the candidates. 
* [Alberto Bacchelli](#Alberto)
* [Georgios Gousios](#Georgios) 
* [Mei Nagappan](#Mei)

The electronic voting period will be from June 5 to June 19, 2017. The results will be announced in the first week of July. Only registered MSR 2017 attendees can vote. We will send voting instructions by email on or before June 5.

## <a name="Alberto"></a>Alberto Bacchelli

Candidate statement:
> The whole idea of mining software repositories has brought dramatic changes to how we conduct empirical software engineering research nowadays, in all SE venues, from ICSE to FSE to ASE, etc.  MSR has been at the forefront of this revolution and made this possible.
> 
> However, one of the risks of being successful (as MSR indeed is) is that the conference will rest on its laurels, instead of trying to improve further. In my tenure, I will focus on making sure that MSR continues to be an incubator of novel ideas and techniques that lead to similar dramatic changes in our community. My focus will be in involving to the MSR community both experienced SE newcomers  (including established researchers at ICSE who are not targeting MSR) and non-SE newcomers (such as researchers in CSCW and CHI) to broaden our visibility, scopre, and community knowledge. Moreover, I will ensure that the important role of the MSR Challenge and the MSR short and data papers is maintained: Good options for students and new researchers to engage with our work. Finally, I will strengthen the importance of having publicly accessible datasets and tools to build upon and move our community faster.
> 
> To conclude, I will also put a strong emphasis into improving logistics of the conference. MSR is growing steadily and quickly, but our current setup is not optimal due to the ever increasing number of submissions and limited presentation time. I will engage with the other members of steering committee and the whole community to find viable and new solutions to this problem to give the right space to a top-tier conference as MSR is.

Biography:
> Alberto Bacchelli is assistant professor at Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands), where he leads a group of 5 Ph.D. students. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2013 from University of Lugano, under the supervision of Michele Lanza. He has been intern researcher at Microsoft Research twice in 2012 and 2013.
> 
> Alberto's research interest is in empirical software engineering, particularly  software analytics. This field emerges from software engineering and data science and its focus is on developing and applying data science processes and techniques to conduct empirical experiments on complex knowledge-based activities, particularly the development of software, and improve their state of the practice. His goal is understanding and improving complex knowledge- based activities, such as software engineering, with processes, practices, and tools informed by data and actors' needs, and by engaging with other disciplines such as social sciences. He tackle research questions with both qualitative and quantitative research approaches.
> 
> Together with his co-authors, Alberto has published at premier software engineering venues such as MSR, ICSE, FSE, ASE, FASE, EMSE and ICSME. He also published at other premier venues such as CSCW and Scientometrics. He co-organized the MUD workshops and the MSR Challenge in 2013. Furthermore, he is PC co-chair of ICSME 2016 tool demo track, SANER 2016 ERA track. He has served in several program committees including MSR, ICSE, FSE, ICSME.

## <a name="Georgios"></a>Georgios Gousios 

Candidate statement:
> I have been part of the MSR community since my PhD days, attending my first MSR in Leipzig, 2008. During those years, I have seen the MSR conference flourishing, reaching top impact status in metrics such as Google Scholar, while still being a cozy, welcoming place for new researchers. As a member of its scientific committee, I would be glad to contribute to the following aspects:>>* Ensuring reproducibility and sharing. MSR submissions have come a long way in terms of reproducibility, especially helped by the data track. There is more to be done though; I believe that MSR should setup an Artifact Evaluation Committee program, similarly to other conferences in the field (ECOOP, FSE etc). Having participated in 4 AEC PCs so far, I believe that the AEC process makes scientific work more reproducible and provides valuable moral support to authors that take the extra mile.>>* Evolving industry participation. MSR techniques are being used by various companies, especially in combination with CI and CD pipelines, but we seldom see companies sharing their results with our community. I believe that we can foster a healthy collaboration with the industry by inviting short paper (or even paperless) submissions from industrial partners.

Biography:
> Dr. Georgios Gousios is an assistant professor at the Web Information Systems group, Delft University of Technology. His research interests include software engineering, software analytics and programming languages. He works in the fields of distributed software development processes, software quality, software testing, developer productivity assessment, research infrastructures and software security. His research has been published in top venues (ICSE, FSE, EMSE, MSR) where he has received 4 best paper awards. In total, he has published more that 50 papers and also co-edited the "Beautiful Architectures" book (OReilly, 2009). He is the main author of the GHTorrent data collection framework, the Alitheia Core repository mining platform, the java-callgraph call graph generator and a co-author of the TravisTorrent dataset. Dr. Gousios holds a PhD in Empirical Software Engineering (mining software repositories) from the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) and an MSc (software engineering) from the University of Manchester.

## <a name="Mei"></a>Mei Nagappan

Candidate statement:
> My first paper in MSR was at MSR 2010 in Cape Town. Even though I was just a PhD student then and just had a short paper, I was welcomed by the community and felt like a part of it from the get-go. Over the last 8 editions, I have greatly benefitted from not just the actual conference (learning about new techniques, datasets and observations) but also from the lasting connections I have made through them. MSR was also my first conference as a PC member through which I learnt how to provide constructive feedback to other authors. 
>
> I think it is now time for me to give back to the community that has helped shape my career. I think there are several great initiatives so far in providing the best platform for presenting rigorous research. I would like to focus on the issue of providing the best feedback to the authors. There are several constraints and challenges facing the reviewers when providing feedback. I would like to work on those challenges and see how we can make the process more useful for the authors and less stressful for the reviewers. 
> 
> Additionally, I would like to see how to recognise students with potential and encourage them to participate and be a part of the MSR community. Currently, the challenge track and data track have done an excellent job at this. I want to examine what else can we do to increase student participation as such students are the future of MSR. In short, I want to examine the steps we can take today that can positively impact the community 10 years from now. As I stated above, I have benefitted from all the hard work of the entire MSR community and would consider it an honour to give back.
