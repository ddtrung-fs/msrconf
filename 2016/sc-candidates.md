## <a name="Bram"></a>Bram Adams

Candidate statement: 
>As member of the MSR SC, I would like to focus on how MSR can sustain its success, while not forgetting its roots as a *working* conference open to new researchers and industry practitioners.
>
MSR technology has gone mainstream, with the large majority of (empirical) papers at conferences like ICSE, FSE or ICSME using MSR ideas as the foundation for their evaluation. So, what makes a paper MSR-ish instead of ICSE-ish? What if the well of new MSR repositories dries up? Should we broaden the conference's scope even further or will MSR as a conference venue eventually become irrelevant? MSR has come to a crucial point in its lifetime where these questions need to be addressed.
>
At the same time, MSR has been and should always be a *working* conference, not a symposium. Hence, group discussions are crucial and are what MSR participants have come to expect. The recent move towards parallel sessions, especially with two parallel research tracks, have started to erode the group discussions. At the same time, avoiding parallel madness by reducing the number of accepted papers might prevent MSR newcomers from attending and enriching the community. Hence, dealing with this contradiction requires important attention.
>
>Finally, another meaning of the word *working* is its reference to industry. While we’ve had keynotes and talks by industry practitioners in the past, they could be involved even more in MSR’s organization. For example, a fixed percentage of the PC could be allocated to industry, or every academic PC member could be asked to bring an industry practitioner to the PC. Oh, and wouldn’t it be cool to do a live mining challenge between academic and industry teams :-)?

Biography:
>Bram Adams is an assistant professor at Polytechnique Montreal (Canada), where he heads the MCIS lab on Maintenance, Construction and Intelligence of Software (MCIS). He obtained his PhD at the GH-SEL lab at Ghent University (Belgium), and was an adjunct assistant professor in the Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab at Queen's University (Canada).
>
>Bram’s research interests include software release engineering and mining software repositories in general, as well as software integration, software build systems and human affect in particular. Since Fall 2013, he teaches a grad course on “Applications of MSR: Release Engineering”, in which he introduces students to the wonderful and varied worlds of MSR and release engineering.
>
>Together with a large group of collaborators, Bram has published at premier software engineering venues such as MSR, TSE, ICSE, FSE, ASE, EMSE and ICSME. He co-organized the PLATE, ACP4IS, MUD, MISS and RELENG workshops, and was one of the co-organizers of the notorious MSR Vision 2020 Summer School in Kingston, ON (Canada). Furthermore, he is PC co-chair of SCAM 2013, SANER 2015 and ICSME 2016, and steering committee member of the SANER conference since 2015.
>
>MSR is by far the top conference venue targeted by the MCIS lab. Bram’s first MSR was the 2009 edition in Vancouver, BC (Canada). Since then, he has been fortunate to attend 7 MSRs as co-author of 2 data and 16 research papers, one of which won a distinguished paper award. He was invited 4 times to the MSR PC, and regularly served as session chair.

## <a name="Georgios"></a>Georgios Gousios 

Candidate statement:
>I have been part of the MSR community since my PhD days, attending my first MSR in Leipzig, 2008. During those years, I have seen the MSR conference flourishing, reaching top impact status in metrics such as Google Scholar, while still being a cozy, welcoming place for new researchers. As a member of its scientific committee, I would be glad to contribute to the following
aspects:
>
>* Ensuring reproducibility and sharing. MSR submissions have come a long way in  terms of reproducibility, especially helped by the data track. There is more  to be done though; I believe that MSR should setup an Artifact Evaluation  Committee program, similarly to other conferences in the field (ECOOP, FSE  etc). Having participated in 4 AEC PCs so far, I believe that the  AEC process makes papers more reproducible and provides valuable moral  support to authors that take the extra mile.
>
>* Evolving industry participation. MSR techniques are being used by various  companies, especially in combination with CI and CD pipelines, but we seldom  see companies sharing their results with our community. I believe that we can  foster a healthy collaboration with the industry by inviting short paper (or  even paperless) submissions from industrial partners.

Biography:
>Georgios Gousios is an assistant professor at the Software Science group, Radboud University Nijmegen (moving to the Web Information Systems group, TU Delft). His research interests include software engineering, software analytics and programming languages.

## <a name="Emad"></a>Emad Shihab

Candidate statement:
>I have been an active member of the MSR community since my PhD student days; when I attended the 5th MSR conference. I was involved in the MSR community in different roles, serving as the web chair, challenge chair, data showcase chair and as a PC member for many years. I promise to work tirelessly to make future MSRs fruitful and welcoming to all, especially students and young researchers. If elected, I would like to see MSR integrate novel ways to deal with (amongst others) a) our rapidly growing community, b) the growing volume and variety of data at our disposable, and c) the actionability and applicability of our MSR techniques. In particular, I would like to introduce a short (late night or overnight) challenge during the MSR conference to facilitate collaboration, especially for newcomers. I would also like to create a database of expertise and data to enable rapid developments of MSR techniques - in many occasions we end up mining data that someone else already has. I would also like to increase the involvement of industry and the open source community in MSR, through panels and invited MSR-reflections abstracts, so our techniques can be actionably grounded. My prior experience involves community service where I served and successfully organized a number of workshops and tacks at MSR and SANER. I am excited at the potential of being part of, and would be honoured to serve on, the MSR steering committee. 

Biography:
>Emad Shihab received his B.Eng, MSc.at the University of Victoria and his PhD from Queen's University.

## <a name="Diomidis"></a>Diomidis Spinellis

Candidate statement:
>Some statements start with by describing how the world is coming to an end and how the candidate plans to save it.  This is not such a statement, because the MSR conference and its community appear to be in excellent health and facing great prospects.  This brings MSR in a position to build on its strengths by innovating and acting as a role model for the wider computer science community.  Here are the ideas (think of them as functional requirements) and values (non-functional requirements) I put forward with my Steering Committee candidacy.
>
>First, we can improve the cooperation of MSR with related conferences, such as ICSE and FSE.  This can include facilities and procedures for relevant submissions, reviews, and presentations to flow from one conference to the other.  Furthermore, we can also explore alternative publishing models, such as journal-first / conference-second, live (continuously updated) papers and artifacts, and quarterly submission deadlines supporting "major revision" decisions.  We can also deepen our engagement with students through a research competition and a PhD symposium.  An important but difficult target is to establish relationships with industry and large open source projects that can benefit our community through the provision of data and research challenges.  Finally, we should explore expanding the conference to include tutorials, tool presentations, demos, and lightning talks.
>
>On more down-to-earth matters, as a member of the MSR Steering Committee, I attend to subscribe to, protect, and promote the values already firmly established in our community: integrity, scientific excellence, innovation, agility, openness, inclusiveness, friendliness, and, yes, fun.
